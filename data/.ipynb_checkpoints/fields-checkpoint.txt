## Invoices ##

* created_at (when invoice was created in the system)
* due (the last date day invoice should be paid)
* last_payment_date (actual invoces payment date)
* total (invoice sum)
* paid (sum that is already paid by this invoice)
* source_system (how invoices extracted)

## Customers ##

* created_at (first time customer appeared in the system)
* score (automatically calculated by system customer score, lower -- better)


Your task is to conduct exploratory data analysis and build a model that will predict whether the invoice will be paid in time or will be overdue. In case of overdue, your model/approach should provide the info when the invoice should be paid. It can be either regression or classification (with periods chosen up to you).

Good luck!
